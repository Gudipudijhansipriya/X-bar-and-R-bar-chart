# X-bar-and-R-bar-chart

An Xbar-R chart is a quality control chart used to plot subgroup means and ranges of individual values from a single characteristic on a given part that were all produced on the same machine. A traditional Xbar-R chart is a single stream of data for a unique Part/Process/Test combination.

# What is it? 
An X-bar and R (range) chart is a pair of control charts used with processes that have a subgroup size of two or more. The standard chart for variables data, X-bar and R charts help determine if a process is stable and predictable. The X-bar chart shows how the mean or average changes over time and the R chart shows how the range of the subgroups changes over time. It is also used to monitor the effects of process improvement theories. As the standard, the X-bar and R chart will work in place of the X-bar and s or median and R chart. 

# When is it used?

You can use X-bar and R charts for any process with a subgroup size greater than one. Typically, it is used when the subgroup size falls between two and ten, and X-bar and s charts are used with subgroups of eleven or more.

Use X-bar and R charts when you can answer yes to these questions:

1. Do you need to assess system stability?

2. Is the data in variables form?

3. Is the data collected in subgroups larger than one but less than eleven?

4. Is the time order of subgroups preserved?
